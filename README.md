ZERO SHOT PROMPTS

Prompt 1: Oil Paint Play

Prompt:
Create a responsive HTML/CSS/JS app "Oil Paint Play" with a white canvas that simulates oil painting: strokes vary in thickness based on drag speed and include droplet effects. Include a fixed header with a logo, a bottom color palette (with custom color option), a right toolbar (Save, Undo, Reset), and an overlay instruction that disappears when drawing starts.



Prompt 2: Picasso Paint Play

Prompt:
Build a responsive HTML/CSS/JS app "Picasso Paint Play" where users create abstract, cubist-style art on a white canvas by generating irregular polygon strokes along their drag path. Include a fixed header with a logo, a bottom color palette (with custom color picker), a right toolbar (Save, Undo, Reset), and an initial instruction overlay that vanishes when drawing begins.



Prompt 3: Vincent Van Gogh Paint Play

Prompt:
Develop a responsive HTML/CSS/JS app "Vincent Van Gogh Paint Play" that simulates swirling, expressive brush strokes on a white canvas. The stroke thickness should adjust with drag speed to create layered, curved strokes. Include a fixed header with a logo, a bottom color palette (with a custom color option), a right toolbar (Save, Undo, Reset), and an instruction overlay that disappears when drawing starts.


DETAILED PROMPTS

Prompt 1: Oil Paint Play

Prompt:
Create a fully functional HTML/CSS/JavaScript web application named “Oil Paint Play – Interactive Oil Paint Canvas.” The application should simulate oil painting by letting users “throw” oil paint droplets onto a white canvas. Key features:

Dynamic Stroke Behavior: The stroke thickness should vary based on the speed of the mouse drag (slower movement = thicker stroke; faster movement = thinner stroke).
Realistic Droplet Effect: Even along the drag path, randomly generate additional droplets to simulate paint being thrown onto the canvas.
User Interface:
A fixed header with a light blue background, a logo image, and the text “Paint PlayIN.”
A color palette at the bottom with several preset colors and a custom color picker option.
A right‑side toolbar with three circular buttons for “Save,” “Undo,” and “Reset.”
A “Follow Me” social link (using an X/Twitter icon) fixed at the bottom left.
Responsive Design: The layout should work seamlessly on both desktop and mobile devices.
Instructions Overlay: Display an initial message (e.g., “Click and Drag to Paint with Oils – Embrace your inner Jackson Pollock”) over the canvas that disappears when the user starts drawing.
Provide the complete code for this application.


Prompt 2: Picasso Paint Play

Prompt:
Create a fully functional HTML/CSS/JavaScript web application named “Picasso Paint Play – Interactive Picasso Style Painting.” The app should allow kids to create abstract, cubist‑inspired paintings using a unique drawing method that generates irregular, polygonal shapes. Key features:

Abstract Drawing Behavior: Implement drawing functions that create random, irregular polygons (with 3–5 vertices) and overlay multiple shapes along the stroke path to evoke a Picasso‑like, fragmented style.
User Interface:
A fixed header with a light blue background, logo, and “Paint PlayIN” text, plus a back button linking to the home page.
A color palette at the bottom with preset color swatches and a custom color picker.
A toolbar on the right with buttons for “Save,” “Undo,” and “Reset.”
A fixed “Follow Me” button (with a social icon) at the bottom left.
Instructions Overlay: Display an instruction message (e.g., “Click and Drag to Create Picasso Art – Unleash your creativity!”) at the center of the canvas that vanishes when drawing begins.
Responsive Design: The app should work well on both desktop and mobile devices.
Provide the complete code for this application.


Prompt 3: Vincent Van Gogh Paint Play

Prompt:
Create a fully functional HTML/CSS/JavaScript web application named “Vincent Van Gogh Paint Play – Interactive Digital Van Gogh Style Painting Experience.” The application should simulate the expressive, swirling brush strokes typical of Van Gogh’s paintings. Key features:

Expressive Brush Strokes: Develop drawing functions that generate swirling, curved, and layered strokes. The strokes should have varying thickness based on the speed of the mouse (or touch) movement. Use multiple overlapping curves to create a textured, dynamic effect reminiscent of Van Gogh’s style.
User Interface:
A fixed header with a light blue background, a logo image, and the text “Paint PlayIN.”
A color palette at the bottom with preset color swatches and a custom color picker option.
A toolbar on the right with circular buttons for “Save,” “Undo,” and “Reset.”
A “Follow Me” social link (with an X/Twitter icon) fixed at the bottom left.
Instructions Overlay: Display an initial message (e.g., “Click and Drag to Create Van Gogh Art – Express your passion!”) centered on the canvas that disappears when drawing starts.
Responsive Design: Ensure the app adapts to both desktop and mobile devices.
Provide the complete code for this application.
